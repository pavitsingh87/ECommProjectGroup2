**Normalization/Denormalization Considerations:**

- Normalization Choice:

      - The database leans towards normalization to maintain data

  integrity, reduce redundancy, and facilitate efficient updates. - Normalized structures support scalability and make it easier to
  manage and update data without inconsistencies.

**Denormalization for Performance:**

- Some degree of denormalization may be considered for performance
  optimization in certain scenarios, such as generating complex reports
  or improving query speed.
- Materialized views or caching mechanisms can be implemented for
  specific use cases without compromising the overall normalized
  structure.

**Balancing Read and Write Operations:**

- The design aims for a balance between read and write operations,
  ensuring that common queries for product information, user details,
  and order history are efficient, while still allowing for
  straightforward updates and inserts.

By following normalization principles, the database for the Hockey
Shockey e-commerce website is designed to provide a solid foundation
for data integrity, scalability, and efficient data retrieval. The
balance between normalization and judicious denormalization is
maintained to meet the specific requirements of the e-commerce
platform.
